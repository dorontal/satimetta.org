	<h1>Practice History</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Mid 1980's</h4>

				<li>
					<p>
						Started with a yoga breathing exercise for calm, combining deep abdominal long breathing
						with visualization.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Dabbled in self-hypnosis, after having read a book on it with exercises, including a
						body scan.
					</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						An interest in the mind is an important component of mindfulness practice. Mindfulness
						is always mindfulness of something, where 'something' is one of four categories of which
						'mind' is one. Mindfulness of mind - awareness of one's mental processes - is one of the <a
							href="/resources/four-foundations-of-mindfulness">Four Foundations of Mindfulness</a
						>. Practicing the four foundations enables further insights about the mind. My interest
						in studying the mind began, partially due to a philosophy class that covered Descartes'
						Meditations, and also due to a biology teacher and mentor, Brian Kahn, who convinced me
						that the brain is the most pressing enigma for humanity to uncover and inspired me to
						study neuroscience.

			<h4>Late 1980's</h4>
			<p>
				Started Tai Chi in 1988, studying with Katherine Hannah, who was Ben Lowe's student, who was
				Prof. Cheng Man Ch'ing's student. I continue doing the Yang Style Short Form twice daily
				until today. I later studied with Maggie Newman, Sifu William Dere, and since the late 80's
				with William C. C. Chen. In 1989, I learned a Chi Kung (Qigong) set from Robert Tangora that
				I still practice and which I have taught a few times. This Chi Kung set was designed as a
				prescription to stretch the spine. As part of Tai Chi, learned a bit more about Taoism, by
				reading Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching.

			<h4>1991 - A talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h4>
			<p>
				In 1991, His Holiness the Dalai Lama came to visit the U.S. for the first time in many
				years. He
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2G-4m4y8Ss">gave his first talk</a> at the university
				where I was studying. I didn't even know who he was. My roommate dragged me to the talk. I went,
				grudgingly, but it ended up being life transforming. The talk was titled "Overcoming Differences".
				The main message was that anger is self-damaging, that is is never is useful, and that we are
				the masters of our own anger - we always have the choice to not engage with anger. This talk
				instantly helped me become a safer driver as it causd a great reduction of driving-related anger.
				After his talk I got his book "The Art of Happiness", which started me on a path of Metta long
				before awareness of breath meditation.

			<h4>2005 - Taught Chi Kung at a gym class</h4>
			<p>
				After the Tai Chi teacher at a gym in my workplace left, I ended up teaching one semester of
				the Chi Kung set I had learned in the late 1980s to coworkers.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>2017 - Started with Bhikkhu Bodhi's teachings</h4>
			<p>
				Before the pandemic, I attended a couple of sutta class lectures by Bhikkhu Bodhi online.
				During the pandemic, and ever since, I've been attending both his Wednesday night Metta
				meditation and chanting session and the Saturday morning sutta class and meditation sessions
				regularly.

			<h4>2019 - First Meditation Retreat - Phuket, Thailand</h4>
			<p>
				Attended a retreat taught by Tobi Warzinek at "Dharana Meditation" in Phuket ("Phuket
				Meditation Center" today). Tobi used a method similar to Ajahn Brahm's. After this retreat,
				I read "Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond" by Ajahn Brahm and continued daily practice with that
				method for a couple of years.
