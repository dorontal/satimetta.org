	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Mid 1980's - Present - Breathwork and Body Scan</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Started breath work: for years it was just one yoga breathing exercise for calm: abdominal
					long breathing using counting and visualization.
				</li>
				<li>Started Body scan practice.</li>
				<li>
					An interest in the mind started in a high school philosophy class that covered Descartes;
					also the biology teacher, Brian Kahn, inspired me by saying that the brain is the most
					pressing enigma left for science to uncover.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>1988 - Present - Tai Chi</h4>
			<p>
				Tai Chi: specializing in Yang Style Short Form of Prof. Tseng Man Ts'ing. Studied with
				Katherine Hannah, Maggie Newman, Sifu William Dere, and since the late 80's with William C.
				C. Chen.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>1989 - Present - Qigong</h4>
			<p>
				Learned a Qigong (Chi Kung) set for stretching and healing the spine, taught by Robert
				Tangora.
			</p>
		</li>

			<h4>1991 - A talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h4>
			<p>
				In 1991, His Holiness the Dalai Lama came to visit the U.S. for the first time in many
				years. He
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2G-4m4y8Ss">gave his first talk</a> at the university
				where I was studying. I didn't even know who he was. My roommate dragged me to the talk. I went,
				grudgingly, but it ended up being life transforming. The talk was titled "Overcoming Differences".
				The main message was that anger is self-damaging, that is is never is useful, and that we are
				the masters of our own anger - we always have the choice to not engage with anger. This talk
				caused me to become a safer driver as this was the first area of application. After his talk
				I got his book "The Art of Happiness", which started me on a path of Metta long before awareness
				of breath meditation practice, though it was not formal Metta practice yet.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>1997 - Neuroscience Ph. D.</h4>
			<p>
				This is somewhat related to mindfulness practice because today researchers try to explain
				the benefits of mindfulness practice, e.g. cases of neuro-prasticity or neurogenesis, via
				neuroscientific observations, mostly related to various parts of the brain. While I prefer
				the psychology narrative, which goes all the way back to the time of the Buddha, I try to
				keep up a bit with the neuroscience narrative, due to its popularity.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>2005 - Taught Chi Kung at a gym class</h4>
			<p>
				After the Tai Chi teacher at a gym in my workplace left, I ended up teaching one semester of
				the Chi Kung set I had learned in the late 1980s to coworkers.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>2015 - Present - Metta Practice</h4>
			<p>
				Before the pandemic, I dabbled in Metta practice at Tibet House in New York City, under the
				instruction of Rachel Hammerman. Since 2019, I've attended Bhikkhu Bodhi's weekly Wednesday
				hour of Metta practice until today.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>2017 - Started with Bhikkhu Bodhi's Sutta Study class</h4>
			<p>
				Before the pandemic, I dabbled in sutta class lectures by Bhikkhu Bodhi online. During the
				pandemic, and ever since, I've been attending the Saturday morning sutta class regularly.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>2019 - First Meditation Retreat - Phuket, Thailand</h4>
			<p>
				Attended a retreat taught by Tobi Warzinek at "Dharana Meditation" in Phuket ("Phuket
				Meditation Center" today). Tobi used a meditation method similar to Ajahn Brahm's. After
				this retreat, I read "Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond" by Ajahn Brahm and continued daily
				practice with that method for a couple of years.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>
				2019 - Present - Started Walking Meditation
				<p>
					The method I first used was baseed on a Theravada method explaine in <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IFvablc6EI">this video</a
					> by Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu. I have continued to practice walking meditation and choose from either
					this method or two other further refined methods, depending on circumstances.
				</p>

			<h4>
				2019 - 2020 - Practiced AJahn Brahm's Meditation Method"
				<p>
					Following the 2019 retreat in Thailand, which was based on Ajahn Brahm's method as
					outlined in his book "Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond", I followed this method according to
					the book for about two years. There are elements from this method that I use to this day,
					but I later switched to practicing the Buddha's 16-step method as described in the
					Ānāpānasati sutta MN 118.
				</p>
			</h4>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>
				2021 - Present - Practiced the Buddha's Method of In/Out Breath Meditation
				<p>
					After studying two suttas in the Middle Length Discourses of the Pali Canon - the
					Satipatthana Sutta (MN 10) and the Ānāpānasati Sutta (MN 118) - I began practicing the
					sixteen step meditation instructions of the Buddha. These steps are a bit vague at places
					and require interpretation. I have read many people's interpretations of the sixteen steps
					and this helped to eventually form my own interpretation.
