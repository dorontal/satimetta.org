				visualization.</p> <p>Dabbled in self-hypnosis, after having read a book on it with exercises, including a body
				scan.</p> <p>An interest in the mind is an important component of mindfulness practice. Mindfulness is
				always mindfulness of something, where &#39;something&#39; is one of four categories of which &#39;mind&#39;
				is one. Mindfulness of mind - awareness of one&#39;s mental processes - is one of the <a href="/resources/four-foundations-of-mindfulness">Four Foundations of Mindfulness</a>. Practicing the four foundations enables further insights about the mind. My interest in
				studying the mind began, partially due to a philosophy class that covered Descartes&#39;
				Meditations, and also due to a biology teacher and mentor, Brian Kahn, who convinced me that
				the brain is the most pressing enigma for humanity to uncover and inspired me to study
				neuroscience.</p></li> <li><h4>Late 1980&#39;s</h4> <p>Started Tai Chi in 1988, studying with Katherine Hannah, who was Ben Lowe&#39;s student, who was
				Prof. Cheng Man Ch&#39;ing&#39;s student. I continue doing the Yang Style Short Form twice daily
				until today. I later studied with Maggie Newman, Sifu William Dere, and since the late 80&#39;s
				with William C. C. Chen. In 1989, I learned a Chi Kung (Qigong) set from Robert Tangora that
				I still practice and which I have taught a few times. This Chi Kung set was designed as a
				prescription to stretch the spine. As part of Tai Chi, learned a bit more about Taoism, by
				reading Lao Tzu&#39;s Tao Te Ching.</p></li> <li><h4>1991 - A talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h4> <p>In 1991, His Holiness the Dalai Lama came to visit the U.S. for the first time in many
				years. He
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2G-4m4y8Ss">gave his first talk</a> at the university
				where I was studying. I didn&#39;t even know who he was. My roommate dragged me to the talk. I went,
				grudgingly, but it ended up being life transforming. The talk was titled &quot;Overcoming Differences&quot;.
				The main message was that anger is self-damaging, that is is never is useful, and that we are
				the masters of our own anger - we always have the choice to not engage with anger. This talk
				instantly helped me become a safer driver as it causd a great reduction of driving-related anger.
				After his talk I got his book &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;, which started me on a path of Metta long
				before awareness of breath meditation.</p></li> <li><h4>2005 - Taught Chi Kung at a gym class</h4> <p>After the Tai Chi teacher at a gym in my workplace left, I ended up teaching one semester of
				the Chi Kung set I had learned in the late 1980s to coworkers.</p></li> <li><h4>2017 - Started with Bhikkhu Bodhi&#39;s teachings</h4> <p>Before the pandemic, I attended a couple of sutta class lectures by Bhikkhu Bodhi online.
				During the pandemic, and ever since, I&#39;ve been attending both his Wednesday night Metta
				meditation and chanting session and the Saturday morning sutta class and meditation sessions
				regularly.</p></li> <li><h4>2019 - First Meditation Retreat - Phuket, Thailand</h4> <p>Attended a retreat taught by Tobi Warzinek at &quot;Dharana Meditation&quot; in Phuket (&quot;Phuket
				Meditation Center&quot; today). Tobi used a method similar to Ajahn Brahm&#39;s. After this retreat,
				I read &quot;Mindfulness, Bliss and Beyond&quot; by Ajahn Brahm and continued daily practice with that
				method for a couple of years.</p></li></ul>`;return{c(){e=d("meta"),n=y(),t=d("div"),t.innerHTML=h,this.h()},l(a){const i=w("svelte-1poa91",document.head);e=l(i,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),i.forEach(s),n=b(a),t=l(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),v(t)!=="svelte-l2n2ot"&&(t.innerHTML=h),this.h()},h(){document.title="Bio",r(e,"name","description"),r(e,"content","Bio"),r(t,"class","text-column")},m(a,i){T(document.head,e),u(a,n,i),u(a,t,i)},p:o,i:o,o,d(a){a&&(s(n),s(t)),s(e)}}}class q extends f{constructor(e){super(),p(this,e,null,I,g,{})}}export{q as component,S as universal};
