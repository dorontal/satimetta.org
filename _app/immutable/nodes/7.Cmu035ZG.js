Here are some brief suggestions
		for managing body tension during meditation: <ul><li><b>Intentional Breathing Reset</b> <p>Temporarily shift to intentional breathing: gently take full, long breaths with a longer
					out-breath than the in-breath, for 3-4 breaths, then return to your meditation method.
					This reset procedure often makes the mind less distractible, even by body tension.</p></li> <li><b>Posture Adjustment</b> <p>Adjusting your posture may help relieve muscle tension. Frequent adjustments, however,
					can distract the mind.</p></li> <li><b>Awareness of Tension with Breath</b> <p>Focus on the area of tension, noticing its sensations and location while noting each leg
					of the breath. Acknowledge the tension without trying to change it, with kindness,
					patience, and self-compassion.</p> <p>Visualizations can support this. E.g, imagine oxygen nourishing your body, especially
					tense areas, on each in-breath. On the out-breath, envision releasing what your body no
					longer needs, perhaps picturing how the carbon dioxide nourishes plants.</p></li> <li><b>Whole Body Awareness With Breath</b> <p>Expand your awareness to the entire body as a whole, while noting each in-breath and
					out-breath. Breathing in, feel the entire body; breathing out, feel the entire body.
					Sometimes focusing on the body as a whole can distract the mind away from any specific
					location where there is pain or tension.</p></li></ul></div></details>`);function f(n){var i=m();l(o=>{var s=u();r.title="Mindfulness Questions and Answers",e(o,s)}),e(n,i)}export{f as component,y as universal};
