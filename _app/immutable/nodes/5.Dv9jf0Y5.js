				visualization.</p> <p>Dabbled in self-hypnosis, after having read a book on it with exercises, including a body
				scan.</p> <p>An interest in the mind is an important component of mindfulness practice. Mindfulness is
				always mindfulness of something, where &#39;something&#39; is one of four categories of which &#39;mind&#39;
				is one. Mindfulness of mind - awareness of one&#39;s mental processes - is one of the <a href="/resources/four-foundations-of-mindfulness">Four Foundations of Mindfulness</a>. Practicing the four foundations enables further insights about the mind. My interest in
				studying the mind began, partially due to a philosophy class that covered Descartes&#39;
				Meditations, and also due to a biology teacher and mentor, Brian Kahn, who convinced me that
				the brain is the most pressing enigma for humanity to uncover and inspired me to study
				neuroscience.</p></li> <li><h4>Late 1980&#39;s</h4> <p>Started Tai Chi in 1988, studying with Katherine Hannah, who was Ben Lowe&#39;s student, who was
				Prof. Cheng Man Ch&#39;ing&#39;s student. I continue doing the Yang Style Short Form twice daily
				until today. I later studied with Maggie Newman, Sifu William Dere, and since the late 80&#39;s
				with William C. C. Chen. In 1989, I learned a Chi Kung (Qigong) set from Robert Tangora that
				I still practice and which I have taught a few times. This Chi Kung set was designed as a
				prescription to stretch the spine. As part of Tai Chi, learned a bit more about Taoism, by
				reading Lao Tzu&#39;s Tao Te Ching.</p></li> <li><h4>1991 - Attended His Holiness the Dalai Lama&#39;s Talk</h4> <p>In 1991, His Holiness the Dalai Lama came to visit the U.S. for the first time in many
				years. He
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2G-4m4y8Ss">gave his first talk</a> at the university
				where I was studying. I didn&#39;t even know who he was. My roommate dragged me to the talk. I went,
				grudgingly, but it ended up being life transforming. The talk was titled &quot;Overcoming Differences&quot;.
				The main message was that anger is self-damaging, that is is never is useful, and that we are
				the masters of our own anger - we always have the choice to not engage with anger. This talk
				instantly helped me become a safer driver as it causd a great reduction of driving-related anger.
				After his talk I got his book &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;, which started me on a path of Metta long
				before awareness of breath meditation.</p></li></ul>`;return{c(){e=d("meta"),n=w(),t=d("div"),t.innerHTML=h,this.h()},l(a){const i=y("svelte-1poa91",document.head);e=l(i,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),i.forEach(s),n=b(a),t=l(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),v(t)!=="svelte-fii8wy"&&(t.innerHTML=h),this.h()},h(){document.title="Bio",r(e,"name","description"),r(e,"content","Bio"),r(t,"class","text-column")},m(a,i){T(document.head,e),c(a,n,i),c(a,t,i)},p:o,i:o,o,d(a){a&&(s(n),s(t)),s(e)}}}class x extends g{constructor(e){super(),p(this,e,null,C,f,{})}}export{x as component,S as universal};
