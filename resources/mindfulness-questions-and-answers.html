			method or exercise, while informal mindfulness practice is about weaving mindfulness into
			everyday activities such as brushing your teeth, washing the dishes or eating. Both types
			start with the intention to be mindful, but formal practice is more structured, with the
			place, time, and type of practice decided ahead of time.</p> <p>Formal practice has the potential to bring the mind to deeper states of collectedness and
			tranquility (and therefore it also can lead to greater insight and mind training) as it allows
			us to use refined methods that we cultivate over time.</p> <p>Informal practice alone isn’t enough for real progress; formal practice creates the depth and
			continuity that make informal mindfulness more effective and meaningful.</p></div></details> <details class="svelte-1c964t7"><summary class="svelte-1c964t7">How Does Mindfulness Practice Differ from Mind-Wandering?</summary> <div class="svelte-1c964t7">When we let our minds wander, our thoughts drive us from one idea or emotion to the next, as if
		we’re in the passenger seat while our thoughts do the driving. In mindfulness practice, however,
		we notice our thoughts when they appear, but we don’t let them drive us. Instead, we gently and
		kindly return our focus to our main object of meditation. Here are some important differences
		between the two: <ul><li><b>Intention and Control</b> <p>Mindfulness involves a deliberate choice to stay in the present moment, while
					mind-wandering happens unintentionally and often leads to distraction. With mindfulness,
					our attention is guided intentionally. In mind-wandering, however, attention operates on
					its own, without conscious direction.</p></li> <li><b>Present Moment Awareneess</b> <p>Mindfulness anchors us in the present, helping us see reality as it is, whereas
					mind-wandering is often about the past or future. This contrast could clarify how
					mindfulness practice strengthens our ability to engage fully with life as it unfolds.</p></li> <li><b>Emotional Awareness</b> <p>Mind-wandering might trigger emotional reactions that go unnoticed. For instance, thoughts
					can drift toward worries or regrets, creating stress or anxiety, while mindfulness invites
					us to notice and be with these emotions.</p></li> <li><b>Brain and Health Benefits</b> <p>Mindfulness not only enhances focus and emotional resilience but also has proven benefits
					for brain health. By training the mind to stay present, mindfulness reduces stress,
					improves cognitive function, and fosters greater emotional regulation. In contrast,
					mind-wandering can often lead to rumination and heightened anxiety, which can negatively
					impact both mental well-being and overall brain function.</p></li></ul></div></details> <details class="svelte-1c964t7"><summary class="svelte-1c964t7">What Mindfulness is Not</summary> <div class="svelte-1c964t7">Some common misconceptions about mindfulness: <ul><li><b>Mindfulness is not the same as mindfulness practice</b> <p>Mindfulness is a faculty of the mind, a "muscle" of the mind that can be strengthened by
					mindfulness practice. Mindfulness practice could either be meditation (formal practice) or
					it can be informal, when we intentionally that leads to the strengthening of the
					midnfulness faculty.</p></li> <li><b>Mindfulness practice is not the same as relaxation</b> <p>While mindfulness practice can lead to a sense of calm, its purpose is not to make you
					relax. It’s about paying attention to the present moment, whatever it may hold, with
					openness, curiosity and kindness.</p></li> <li><b>Mindfulness practice is not a quick fix</b> <p>Mindfulness is a skill that develops gradually, like building strength at the gym. With
					consistent, disciplined practice, mindfulness grows stronger over time. Just as muscles
					can weaken without regular exercise, our ability to stay mindful can fade if we don't keep
					practicing. Only steady, ongoing practice creates lasting benefits.</p></li> <li><b>Mindfulness is not about getting rid of thoughts or emotions</b> <p>Instead of trying to stop thinking or avoid feelings, mindfulness involves noticing and
					accepting them as they arise, without attaching too much meaning or reacting to them.</p></li> <li><b>Mindfulness practice is not a mental escape</b> <p>In mindfulness practice, we bravely engage with whatever arises in the mind, rather than
					avoiding it. We stay alert and attentive to our thoughts and feelings. This awareness
					distinguishes mindfulness from forms of mental escape, like using substances or getting
					lost in mind-wandering.</p></li></ul></div></details> <details class="svelte-1c964t7"><summary class="svelte-1c964t7">Feeling body tension during meditation</summary> <div class="svelte-1c964t7">It’s common for tension to build in the body during meditation. Here are some brief suggestions
		for managing body tension during meditation: <ul><li><b>Intentional Breathing Reset</b> <p>Temporarily shift to intentional breathing: gently take full, long breaths with a longer
					out-breath than the in-breath, for 3-4 breaths, then return to your meditation method.
					This reset procedure often makes the mind less distractible, even by body tension.</p></li> <li><b>Posture Adjustment</b> <p>Adjusting your posture may help relieve muscle tension. Frequent adjustments, however, can
					distract the mind.</p></li> <li><b>Awareness of Tension with Breath</b> <p>Focus on the area of tension, noticing its sensations and location while noting each leg
					of the breath. Acknowledge the tension without trying to change it, with kindness,
					patience, and self-compassion.</p> <p>Visualizations can support this. E.g, imagine oxygen nourishing your body, especially
					tense areas, on each in-breath. On the out-breath, envision releasing what your body no
					longer needs, perhaps picturing how the carbon dioxide nourishes plants.</p></li> <li><b>Whole Body Awareness With Breath</b> <p>Expand your awareness to the entire body as a whole, while noting each in-breath and
					out-breath. Breathing in, feel the entire body; breathing out, feel the entire body.
					Sometimes focusing on the body as a whole can distract the mind away from any specific
					location where there is pain or tension.</p></li></ul></div></details><!----><!----></main></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]--></div>
