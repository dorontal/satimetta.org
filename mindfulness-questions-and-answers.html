href="https://www.mindful.org/jon-kabat-zinn-defining-mindfulness/">Jon Kabat-Zinn's definition</a>: Mindfulness is awareness that arises from paying attention on purpose, in the present
				moment, non-judgmentally.</p> <p>The above definition of mindfulness refers to the mental capacity for mindfulness. This
				capacity can fluctuate throughout the day, but it can also be strengthened over time, much
				like a muscle, through consistent daily practice. The term <b>trait mindfulness</b> descries the baseline level of mindfulness - the steady, underlying mindfulness capacity of the
				mind. <b>State mindfulness</b>, on the other hand, refers to the momentary experience of
				mindfulness. A helpful way to distinguish between the two is to think of state mindfulness
				as answering the question, "How mindful are you right now?" and trait mindfulness as
				answering, "How mindful are you these days?"</p> <p><b>Mindfulness practice</b> refers to the activities and exercises aimed at cultivating mindfulness.
				It is the process that strengthens trait mindfulness, enhances the average level of state mindfulness,
				and generally improves the mind's capacity to be mindful. The term mindfulness practice can refer
				to: (a) a regular daily routine of practicing mindfulness, (b) a specific meditation session,
				(c) various types of mindfulness meditations, or (d) informal practices where mindfulness is
				applied to everyday activities.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="what-mindfulness-is-not"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">What mindfulness is not</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>Some common misconceptions about mindfulness:</p> <p><b>Mindfulness</b> is not the same as <b>mindfulness practice</b>: <b>Mindfulness</b> is a quality of the mind (see the definition of mindfulness question,

				this skill - just as a muscle can be strengthened via repeated workout.</p> <p><b>Mindfulness practice is not the same as relaxation:</b> While mindfulness practice may lead to calmness, its purpose is not relaxation. It's about paying
				attention to the present moment - whatever it holds - with openness, curiosity, and kindness.</p> <p><b>Mindfulness practice is not a quick fix:</b> Like building physical strength at the gym, mindfulness develops gradually with consistent practice.
				Without regular effort, mindfulness may weaken. Steady, ongoing practice creates lasting benefits.</p> <p><b>Mindfulness is not about getting rid of thoughts or emotions:</b> Instead of avoiding or suppressing thoughts and feelings, mindfulness involves noticing and accepting
				them as they arise, without attaching meaning or reacting to them.</p> <p><b>Mindfulness practice is not a mental escape:</b> When applied to daily life, mindfulness encourages engagement with whatever arises in the mind,
				rather than avoiding it. This distinguishes mindfulness from mental escapes like using substances
				or getting lost in daydreams.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="meditation-vs-mindfulness-practice"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">What's the difference between meditation and mindfulness practice?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>Meditation encompasses a variety of practices used for different purposes across the world's

				When a meditation practice directly cultivates mindfulness - it can be referred to as a
				formal mindfulness practice.</p> <p>However, mindfulness practice - e.g, informal mindfulness practice - can occur without

				may happen in two ways: (1) staying closely aware of everyday activities like eating or
				brushing your teeth, or (2) maintaining continuous attention on something like the breath or
				posture throughout the day.</p> <p>Informal practice brings more ease, presence, and balance to daily life. It supports calm
				and clarity but may not, on its own, lead to deep insight. Formal practice allows the mind
				to settle more deeply - developing focus, tranquility, and insight - but without informal
				practice, its development is hindered.</p> <p>Both forms of practice strengthen and support each other - formal practice builds the
				capacity for mindfulness, while informal practice keeps it alive throughout the day and
				deepens formal meditation in return.</p> <p>Sustained progress depends on both.

				or choiceless awareness?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>In mindfulness practice, <strong>open awareness</strong> refers to a state of staying receptive
				to whatever arises in the present moment, without choosing a specific object to focus on. This
				approach contrasts with focusing on a single object, such as the breath, where attention remains
				fixed on just one thing, known as the "anchor."</p> <p>With open awareness, the “object” (or "anchor") of meditation naturally shifts as new
				sensations, thoughts, or emotions arise, allowing for a dynamic and fluid focus. In such
				meditations, the anchor is the present moment itself, not a specific object within it. The
				term <strong>choiceless awareness</strong>, coined by J. Krishnamurti, is also used to
				describe this practice. It emphasizes the lack of preference for any particular focus,
				keeping the mind open and observant of the entire experience as it unfolds.</p> <p>Open awareness is an <strong>advanced practice</strong>. For individuals with highly
				distractible minds or those new to mindfulness, it can be particularly challenging. Instead
				of cultivating mindful openness, the experience may easily slip into mind-wandering (see the
				question below about how mindfulness differs from mind-wandering). For most people, it is
				advisable to still the mind first, e.g, via mindfulness of breathing, before switching to
				open awareness.</p> <p>Open awareness can serve as a valuable <strong>preparatory step</strong> for focused meditation
				such as awareness of breathing. Starting with open awareness before focusing on a single object
				helps ease the transition from a scattered, everyday state of mind to focusing on just one thing.
				A brief period of open awareness at the start of a session allows the mind to settle naturally
				into the present moment, creating a gentle bridge toward a refined focus on a single object.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="mindfulness-practice-vs-mind-wandering"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">How does mindfulness practice differ from mind wandering?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>When we let our minds wander, our thoughts drive us from one idea or emotion to the next, as
				if we're in the passenger seat while our thoughts do the driving. In mindfulness practice,
				however, we notice our thoughts when they appear, but we don't let them drive us. Instead,
				we gently and kindly return our focus to our main object of meditation. Here are some
				important differences between the two:</p> <ul><li><b>Intention and Control</b> <p>Mindfulness involves a deliberate choice to stay in the present moment, while mind
						wandering happens unintentionally and often leads to distraction. With mindfulness, our
						attention is guided intentionally. In mind wandering, however, attention operates on its
						own, without conscious direction.</p></li> <li><b>Present Moment Awareneess</b> <p>Mindfulness anchors us in the present, helping us see reality as it is, whereas mind
						wandering is often about the past or future. This contrast could clarify how mindfulness
						practice strengthens our ability to engage fully with life as it unfolds.</p></li> <li><b>Emotional Awareness</b> <p>mind wandering might trigger emotional reactions that go unnoticed. For instance,
						thoughts can drift toward worries or regrets, creating stress or anxiety, while
						mindfulness invites us to notice and be with these emotions.</p></li> <li><b>Brain and Health Benefits</b> <p>Mindfulness not only enhances focus and emotional resilience but also has proven
						benefits for brain health. By training the mind to stay present, mindfulness reduces
						stress, improves cognitive function, and fosters greater emotional regulation. In
						contrast, mind wandering can often lead to rumination and heightened anxiety, which can
						negatively impact both mental well-being and overall brain function.</p></li></ul></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="relationship-between-prayer-and-mindfulness-practice"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">What's the relationship between prayer and mindfulness practice?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>Prayer can be seen as a conversation - expressing gratitude, seeking guidance, or making
				requests. Mindfulness, in contrast, is about being fully present without trying to change
				anything. Instead of asking for something, mindfulness involves observing thoughts,
				emotions, and sensations with openness and non-reactivity. Practicing mindfulness can help
				us engage with life as it unfolds - with greater clarity and acceptance.</p> <p>Mindfulness is not a religious practice and does not conflict with prayer. In fact, the two
				can complement each other. Mindfulness can make prayer more intentional by helping us be
				fully present - whether by meditating before prayer or by approaching prayer itself as a
				mindful practice. Conversely, the repetition in some forms of prayer can foster a meditative
				state - allowing the mind to settle and the heart to open to deeper spiritual experiences.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="body-tension-during-meditation"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">What to do about body tension during meditation?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>It's common for tension to build in the body during meditation. Here are some brief
				suggestions for managing body tension during meditation:</p> <ul><li><b>Intentional breath reset</b> <p>Temporarily shift to intentional breathing - gently take full, long breaths, letting the
						out-breath be slightly longer than the in-breath, for 3-4 breath cycles. Then allow the
						breath to return to its natural rhythm - without controlling or shaping it. This kind of
						reset often helps calm the mind and reduce distractibility.</p></li> <li><b>Awareness of tension and its relation to the breath</b> <p>Bring your attention to the area of tension. Notice the sensations and where they’re
						located, while staying aware of each in-breath and out-breath. As you breathe, observe
						how each part of the breath - the in-breath and the out-breath - affects the tension.
						Acknowledge the tension without trying to change it, with kindness, patience, and
						self-compassion.</p> <p>Visualizations can help: for example, on each in-breath, imagine oxygen nourishing every
						cell in body, especially at the tense areas. On each out-breath, envision that releasing
						what your body no longer needs helps further release the tension.</p></li> <li><b>Whole body awareness and its relation to the breath</b> <p>Expand your awareness to include the entire body, while staying connected to the
						awareness of each in-breath and out-breath. Breathing in, feel the whole body; breathing
						out, feel the whole body. This broader focus can sometimes help shift attention away
						from specific areas of pain or tension.</p></li> <li><b>Posture adjustment</b> <p>Adjusting your posture can sometimes ease tension, but frequent shifting tends to
						distract the mind. Try to minimize major movements unless truly necessary. That said,
						even when the body seems still, it's always in motion - the breath, the heartbeat,
						circulating fluids, and subtle muscular shifts are constantly happening. Rather than
						trying to be perfectly still, which can create resistance and more tension, you might
						experiment with gently tuning in to these natural movements. This shift in perspective
						can support a more accepting and relaxed relationship with physical discomfort.</p></li></ul></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="i-dont-get-mindfulness-of-breathing"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">"I just don't get this mindfulness of breathing practice."</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>It's totally understandable to feel like you don't ‘get' breath meditation. But the good
				news is, meditation isn't about getting it right - it's about showing up. Every time you
				sit, you're training your mind in some way, even if it doesn't feel like it. There's no such
				thing as a bad meditation. Maybe you notice frustration, restlessness, or boredom - that's
				insight. Maybe you notice tiny moments of focus - that's also insight. The key is to keep
				practicing and stay curious about whatever shows up, with openness and kindness.</p> <p>It's also useful and important to keep practicing regularly - not just formal practice of at
				least ten minutes per day, everyday, but also informal practice throughout each day, such as
				mindfulness of posture, mindfulness of breathing in and out in all activities, or
				mindfulness of daily activities. It's also useful to know that it may take a long time until
				we notice the positive changes that the practice brings.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="dealing-with-strong-thoughts-before-meditating"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">"When I get strong thoughts on my mind, should I deal with them first, before meditating?"</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>It's natural to feel like you need to sort things out before meditating - but one of the
				best ways to train the mind is to meditate even when it feels inconvenient. This is why it's
				helpful to set a clear intention for practice, to schedule a start and end time, never
				stumbling onto meditation by a fluke. For example, we might commit to meditating every
				morning as soon as we wake up or every time we gather in class or with a group. Setting this
				intention ahead of time helps us stick with practice even when thoughts feel overwhelming -
				we know this is our time to put them aside, trusting that we can return to them later. If
				we're able to do that, then when we come back to these thoughts after formal meditation, the
				mind will be clearer and better able to deal with them. A calmer, more concentrated mind
				always sees things more clearly - allowing us to handle those thoughts more skillfully than
				if we had rushed to address them and skipped meditation instead.</p></div></details> <hr class="hr"/> <details class="group p-2"><summary class="grid cursor-pointer list-none grid-cols-[1.25rem_auto] items-center marker:hidden [&amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:hidden" id="relying-on-pleasant-external-conditions-for-meditation"><span class="transform transition-transform duration-200 group-open:rotate-90">⯈</span> <span class="ml-2">Is it okay to rely on pleasant external conditions to support meditation?</span></summary> <div class="p-group"><p>In principle, one should be able to meditate in any situation - even in the middle of a
				crowded train station or a household with kids yelling, TV blaring, and phones ringing. But
				the more your senses get bombarded, the harder it is for the mind to become undistractable.</p> <p>When advice is given to meditators to accept whatever comes up without judgment - whether
				it's discomfort, restlessness, or distraction - and to return to the object of meditation
				again and again, that doesn't mean you shouldn't make your meditation experience as
				supportive as possible. In fact, especially as a beginner, it's completely fine - and even
				wise - to lean on helpful outer conditions like a calm environment. These are not crutches -
				they're supports.</p> <p>Even the Buddha began his meditation instructions encouraging finding useful external
				conditions: “Having gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut...” The
				setting matters. A peaceful space makes it easier to settle the body and mind. And that's
				true whether you're a beginner or not.</p> <p>In short: whatever you can do to make your meditation more comfortable, more pleasant, and
				last longer - go for it. Just keep an eye out for a few common pitfalls:</p> <ul><li><p><b>Don't overdo the setup.</b> If you find yourself constantly tweaking, preparing, or delaying your meditation until everything
						is perfect, it becomes a reason not to meditate.</p></li> <li><p><b>Don't get attached to your setup.</b> Eventually, you'll find yourself without your setup - when traveling, visiting family, or
						just having a busy day. Instead of seeing that as a problem, treat it as a gift - a teacher.
						It's a chance to train in flexibility and resilience.</p></li> <li><p><b>Make a commitment to stay.</b> Whatever your setup, designate the minimum time you'll be meditating before you begin. If
						you realize mid-meditation that you forgot some part of your setup - don't stop your meditation.
						Stay with it until the end of the time period that you had committed to. Let that moment
						be part of the practice.</p></li> <li><p><b>Start with a preparation phase.</b> Before you meditate, but after you have already assumed a meditation posture, make sure you
						have a preparation phase. A strong preparation sets a strong foundation that prevents the
						meditation from collapsing too easily.</p></li></ul> <p>And finally, remember that inner conditions matter too: kindness, curiosity, patience -
				these are at least as important as silence or other supportive external conditions. As you
				continue, you'll build the strength to meet a wider range of conditions, inside and out,
				with presence and ease. It's a gradual training, and you're already in it.</p></div></details></div><!----><!----></main></div></div></div><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
